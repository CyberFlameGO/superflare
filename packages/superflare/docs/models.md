title: Models (D1)
---

Models are a handy way to interact with your [D1 database](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/). They provide a layer of abstraction between your database and your application, allowing you to define relationships between models and easily query for data.

D1 tables are created using native SQLlite migrations:

```sql
create table posts (
  id integer primary key,
  title text not null,
  createdAt timestamp not null default current_timestamp
  updatedAt timestamp not null default current_timestamp
);
```

Models are defined as TypeScript classes. Model class names correspond directly to the table names in the database. For example, a `posts` table would have a corresponding `Post` model:

```typescript
import { Model } from "superflare";

export class Post extends Model {
  toJSON(): PostRow {
    return super.toJSON();
  }
}

Model.register(Post);

/* superflare-types-start */
interface PostRow {
  id!: number;
  name!: string;
  title!: string;
  createdAt!: Date;
  updatedAt!: Date;
}

export interface Post extends PostRow {}
/* superflare-types-end */
```

Superflare provides utilities to help you keep your model's type definition in sync with your database. Type definitions are created as an interface below your model class definition. For example, the `Post` model will have a corresponding `PostRow` interface defined by Superflare.

{% callout title="Autogenerated types" %}
Do not manually modify any code within the `/* superflare-types-* */` markers. It is automatically generated by Superflare and will be overwritten when you run `npx superflare migrate`.
{% /callout %}

When you migrate your database, Superflare will automatically update your interfaces to match the new database schema.

```
npx superflare migrate
```

When you create a new table in a migration, you can run the following command to generate a new corresponding model for the table with types:

```
npx superflare migrate --create
```

## Registering Models

You must call `Model.register` after defining each model. This is how Superflare knows which models to load when you run [Jobs](/queues) and other background tasks.

## Creating Models

You can create a new model by running the following command:

```
npx superflare generate model Post
```

By default, a new model will be created in the `app/models` directory. You can change this by passing the `--path` flag:

```
npx superflare generate model Post --path app/my-models
```

You can also create a migration for your new model at the same time by passing the `--migration` or `-m` flag:

```
npx superflare generate model Post --migration
```
