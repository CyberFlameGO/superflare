title: Introduction to Superflare
---

[Superflare](https://superflare.dev) is the missing full-stack toolkit for Cloudflare Workers. It features a relational ORM for [D1 databases](/models/getting-started), utilities for [R2 storage](/file-storage), and more.

Superflare is _not_ a full-stack framework. In fact, Superflare works best when combined with [Remix](https://remix.run), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) (soon!) or [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.com) (soon!).

Check out various Superflare [example apps](https://github.com/jplhomer/superflare/tree/main/examples/) to get a feel for what you can build next, or get started with a new Superflare application below.

## Installation

(soon!) Spin up a brand-new Superflare project with the following command:

```bash
npx superflare init
```

Superflare will ask you which bindings you'd like to use for D1, R2 and KV. It will also offer to create the bindings if you haven't already!

Once you get your project created, you can start a local development server with:

```bash
npx superflare dev
```
